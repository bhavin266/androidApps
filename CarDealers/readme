**Project Definition**

For this project you will design and code a new Android app that implements the following functionality.
The main activity in the app displays a grid. Each grid cell contains a thumbnail picture of a car (from
outside the car) above the name of the car’s manufacturer. For instance, a grid cell could contain a thumbnail
showing a Honda Civic, above the name “Honda”. 
Each grid cell supports two kinds of functionality, depending on whether an app viewer performs a short
vs. a long click on a cell. A short click brings up a new activity that shows the entire picture of the selected
car on the entire device display. This picture must be a higher resolution and bigger than the thumbnail
displayed earlier. The user can return to the grid view by selecting the “back” soft button on the phone.
However, if a user clicks on the displayed picture instead, you must open a browser activity showing the
web site of the car’s manufacturer. For instance, if your app shows a picture of a Honda Civic, the app
should bring up the Honda web page from the official Honda web site.
A long click on a grid cell brings up a “context menu” showing the following three options for the car
under consideration: (1) View the entire picture (similar to a short click); (2) Show the official web page of
the car manufacturer in a new activity; and (3) bring up a list containing the names and addresses of at least
three car dealers for the selected manufacturer in greater Chicago area
